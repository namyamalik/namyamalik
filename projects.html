			<h4>CS 29/PSYC 15 (Impact Design): Personalized Jean Jacket</h4>
			<h5>October-November 2018</h5>
			<p>This class matched Dartmouth students with an autistic student at a local
			school for autistic children. The goal of the class was for every group to build 
			a long-lasting and delightful product for their autistic student.
			<p>My group was matched with Abby, a 12 year old girl with a developmental age 
			of 4-6 years. Through our visits with Abby, we found out important details such
			as that she is nonverbal, very social, loves all-things girly & Disney, and has three 
			sisters & doesn’t get as much personalized attention at home. We were tasked
			with the question of creating a meaningful product and experience for Abby that would be special for 
			her and that she could share with people in her life.</p>			
			<p>Our final product was a personalized jean jacket. We obtained patches that were customized
			to Abby's interests (Disney, food, princessess, etc.) and attached velcro to the back
			of each patch. We also attached velcro to the back and sleeves of the jacket.
			Our goal was that the jacket would be a long-lasting product, but at the same 
			time, Abby could customize the jacket herself by placing whichever velcro 
			patches on the jacket wherever she wanted.</p>
			<p>We used the design thinking process throughout the term by ideating, prototyping,
			iterating, and finally executing. Abby loved the jacket and got emotional when 
			she received it. She was excited to come to school to wear the jacket and wore it consistently 
			following our final visit.</p>

			<h4>ENGS 31 (Digital Electronics): Combinational Lock</h4>
			<h5>August 2018</h5>
			<p>For our final project, my parter and I created a combination lock with LED 
			indicators and an autolock-out mode. Our project required a Basys3 FPGA board, Pmod-Keypad, 
			Pmod-breadboard, 2 LEDs, and 2 resistors. We used VHDL to program the Basys3 board.</p>
			<p>Our combinational lock compares a user's 4-digit keypad input to a hardwired 
			solution. The Basys3 board is connected to the breadboard with 2 output LED 
			indicators that are wired to turn on and off depending on the solution. If the 
			user makes three consecutive failed passcode attempts, the autolock 
			feature engages and the lock cannot be operated until ten seconds have 
			passed (in a real world application this would be longer). When the lock is in 
			autolock mode, the characters ‘dEAd’ show up on the seven segment display. This function 
			is similar to that found on many popular smartphones and prevents brute force entry
			to the device through repeated password attempts.</p>
