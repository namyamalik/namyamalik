#### To-Do:
* have modal box shadow extend to cover up the header
* when user clicks outside of modal, modal should close
* smoothscrolling.js: how do you scrol in vw? Scrolling to a section doesnâ€™t work on phone because the spacing is different. The -120 is in pixels I think?
* how to put an external link to published paper or youtube video inside a modal?
* Domain name is from namecheap. Expires in July 2021. Will need to use different email alias to keep site published.

* update projects section with recent projects
